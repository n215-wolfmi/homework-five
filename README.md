This assignment was to create the about page from the adobe xd design document along with making it responsive. This soilidified some knowledge from the previous assignment, sort of as a repetition in order to hone my skills in responsiveness in terms of percentages and media queries. I added a media query to the footer which changes the items to have a flex direction of column which allows them to fit together at a smaller window size. One other thing that I have finally understood fully is setting the max-width of an entire div "section" to a certain amount and setting the actaul width to a percentage which allows the "section" contents to respond to changes of the window's size. I used this technique in the about section, nav, and footer to scale the sections as the page gets smaller. Overall, this assignment was a good repition practice to help me hone my skills in creating a page from a design document as well as making it responsive (percentages / media queries).
